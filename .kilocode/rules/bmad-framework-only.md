## Brief overview
This rule establishes that all development must exclusively use the bmad core framework as the primary development framework.

## Framework usage
- Only use the bmad core framework for all development tasks
- Do not introduce or use alternative frameworks unless absolutely necessary
- All architectural decisions should prioritize bmad core framework compatibility
- When evaluating new libraries or tools, ensure they integrate seamlessly with bmad core

## Development approach
- Leverage bmad core framework's built-in features and conventions
- Follow bmad core framework's established patterns and best practices
- Utilize bmad core framework's documentation and community resources
- Customize within the framework's extension points rather than working around it

## Project structure
- Organize code according to bmad core framework's recommended structure
- Use bmad core framework's naming conventions and file organization
- Implement features using bmad core framework's provided abstractions
- Maintain consistency with bmad core framework's architectural patterns

## Decision making
- When faced with implementation choices, default to bmad core framework solutions
- Consider bmad core framework alternatives before external solutions
- Evaluate new dependencies based on bmad core framework compatibility
- Prioritize solutions that align with bmad core framework's philosophy and design principles
