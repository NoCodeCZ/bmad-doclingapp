# Story 3.5: Workshop Rehearsal & Final Validation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** workshop facilitator,
**I want** a full rehearsal of workshop scenarios with real users,
**so that** we identify any remaining issues before October 17.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Rehearsal session conducted with 5-10 internal testers simulating workshop conditions: each tester uploads their own real documents, uses mobile and desktop devices
2. Testers follow complete workflow: access production URL → upload document → configure options → wait for processing → download markdown → upload to Open WebUI
3. Observed pain points documented: confusing UI elements, unclear error messages, unexpected failures, accessibility issues (keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility)
4. Success metrics measured: task completion rate (% who successfully download markdown), time to completion, error rate, user satisfaction score (1-5 scale)
5. Critical issues fixed immediately: blocking errors, major UX confusion, accessibility failures preventing task completion
6. Nice-to-have improvements deferred: minor polish, edge case handling, features beyond MVP scope
7. Workshop day runbook created: troubleshooting guide for facilitators, escalation path for technical issues, contact information for on-call developer, known limitations to communicate to attendees

**Success Metrics Framework:**
```python
class RehearsalMetrics:
    def __init__(self):
        self.testers = []
        self.completion_times = []
        self.error_events = []
        self.satisfaction_scores = []
        self.issues_observed = []
    
    def track_tester_progress(self, tester_id, step, timestamp, success=True, error=None):
        event = {
            'tester_id': tester_id,
            'step': step,
            'timestamp': timestamp,
            'success': success,
            'error': error
        }
        self.testers.append(event)
        
        if error:
            self.error_events.append(event)
    
    def calculate_completion_rate(self):
        total_testers = len(set(t['tester_id'] for t in self.testers))
        completed_testers = len(set(t['tester_id'] for t in self.testers if t['step'] == 'download_completed'))
        return (completed_testers / total_testers) * 100 if total_testers > 0 else 0
    
    def calculate_average_completion_time(self):
        completion_times = []
        for tester_id in set(t['tester_id'] for t in self.testers):
            tester_events = [t for t in self.testers if t['tester_id'] == tester_id]
            start_time = min(e['timestamp'] for e in tester_events if e['step'] == 'upload_started')
            end_time = max(e['timestamp'] for e in tester_events if e['step'] == 'download_completed')
            completion_times.append((end_time - start_time).total_seconds())
        
        return sum(completion_times) / len(completion_times) if completion_times else 0
```

### Issue Classification System
[Source: docs/architecture.md#Error-Handling]

**Issue Severity Classification:**
```typescript
interface IssueClassification {
  severity: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  category: 'ui_ux' | 'functional' | 'accessibility' | 'performance' | 'integration';
  impact: 'blocking' | 'major_impact' | 'minor_impact' | 'cosmetic';
  urgency: 'immediate' | 'before_workshop' | 'post_workshop' | 'future';
}

const issueMatrix: IssueClassification[] = [
  {
    severity: 'critical',
    category: 'functional',
    impact: 'blocking',
    urgency: 'immediate',
    description: 'Users cannot complete the end-to-end workflow'
  },
  {
    severity: 'high',
    category: 'ui_ux',
    impact: 'major_impact',
    urgency: 'before_workshop',
    description: 'Significant confusion preventing task completion'
  },
  {
    severity: 'medium',
    category: 'accessibility',
    impact: 'major_impact',
    urgency: 'before_workshop',
    description: 'Accessibility barriers for some users'
  }
];
```

### Workshop Day Runbook Structure
[Source: docs/architecture.md#Documentation-Standards]

**Runbook Sections:**
```markdown
# Workshop Day Runbook

## Pre-Workshop Checklist
- [ ] Production environment health check
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards active
- [ ] Backup procedures verified
- [ ] Communication channels tested
- [ ] Facilitator materials prepared

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Upload Issues
**Problem**: File upload fails with "File too large" error
**Solution**: Check file size, recommend splitting large documents
**Escalation**: Level 1 facilitator can handle

### Processing Issues
**Problem**: Document processing takes longer than expected
**Solution**: Explain processing time varies by complexity, use Quality mode for better results
**Escalation**: Contact on-call developer if >5 minutes

### Download Issues
**Problem**: Markdown download button not working
**Solution**: Refresh page, check browser compatibility
**Escalation**: Level 2 facilitator, then on-call developer

### Open WebUI Integration Issues
**Problem**: Markdown not appearing in Open WebUI
**Solution**: Verify file format, check upload to correct workspace
**Escalation**: Level 2 facilitator

## Escalation Path
1. **Level 1 Facilitator**: Common issues, user guidance
2. **Level 2 Facilitator**: Technical issues, troubleshooting
3. **On-call Developer**: System issues, critical failures
4. **Workshop Lead**: Decision making, major issues

## Emergency Contacts
- On-call Developer: [Name] - [Phone] - [Email]
- Workshop Lead: [Name] - [Phone] - [Email]
- Technical Support: [Name] - [Phone] - [Email]

## Known Limitations
- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Supported formats: PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX
- Processing time: 30 seconds to 5 minutes
- Language support: English only
