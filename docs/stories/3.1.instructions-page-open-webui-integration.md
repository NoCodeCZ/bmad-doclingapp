# Story 3.1: Instructions Page for Open WebUI Integration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** workshop attendee,
**I want** clear step-by-step instructions for using processed markdown in Open WebUI,
**so that** I can successfully complete the end-to-end workflow from document upload to RAG usage.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Instructions page accessible from main navigation (link visible on upload screen and success screen)
2. Step-by-step guide with numbered instructions: (1) Process document using this tool, (2) Download markdown file, (3) Open Open WebUI, (4) Navigate to RAG/Documents section, (5) Upload markdown file, (6) Verify document appears in knowledge base
3. Screenshots or annotated images showing Open WebUI interface for each step (RAG navigation, upload button, confirmation screen)
4. Troubleshooting section addresses common issues: "Markdown not appearing in RAG" → check file format, "AI responses still inaccurate" → verify document uploaded to correct workspace
5. Tips for optimal results: "Use Quality mode for complex documents", "Enable OCR for scanned PDFs", "Break very large documents into sections"
6. Responsive layout: instructions readable on mobile devices, images scale appropriately without horizontal scrolling
7. "Back to Upload" navigation link returns users to main application flow

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-06

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Review Summary

Story 3.1 provides comprehensive requirements for creating an instructions page that guides users through the end-to-end workflow from document processing to Open WebUI usage. The story is well-structured with clear acceptance criteria and detailed implementation guidance.

### Strengths

1. **Comprehensive User Guidance**: Step-by-step instructions with visual support address the complete user journey
2. **Accessibility Focus**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements ensure inclusive design
3. **Mobile-First Approach**: Responsive design considerations for workshop attendees using various devices
4. **Troubleshooting Support**: Proactive addressing of common issues reduces user frustration
5. **Performance Considerations**: Image optimization and lazy loading strategies included

### Areas of Concern

1. **Screenshot Asset Availability**: No actual Open WebUI screenshots available, requiring creation during development
2. **Content Accuracy Risk**: Instructions must match actual Open WebUI interface to avoid user confusion
3. **Navigation Integration Complexity**: Integration points with existing navigation need careful implementation

### Recommendations

1. **Create Screenshots Early**: Acquire Open WebUI access and create annotated screenshots before development
2. **Content Validation Process**: Implement review process to ensure instructions match actual interface
3. **Incremental Development**: Start with basic navigation, then add visual assets and advanced features

### Test Coverage Assessment

- ✅ Navigation functionality tests planned
- ✅ Responsive design tests included
- ✅ Accessibility tests specified
- ✅ Image loading tests covered
- ⚠️ Content accuracy validation needs implementation plan

### Production Readiness

The story addresses critical workshop success factors by providing clear user guidance. While there are concerns about asset availability and content accuracy, these can be addressed during development with proper planning.
