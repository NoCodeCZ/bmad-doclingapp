\n# Story 1.4: Backend File Upload & Storage\n\n## Status\nDraft\n\n## Story\n**As a** backend service,\n**I want** file upload endpoint that validates and stores documents in Supabase,\n**so that** uploaded files are securely stored and tracked for processing.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. `POST /api/upload` endpoint accepts multipart/form-data file uploads with server-side validation (file type, size limits)\n2. Uploaded file stored in Supabase `uploads` bucket with unique filename (UUID-based to prevent collisions)\n3. Document metadata record created in `documents` table with status='queued', original filename, and processing options placeholder\n4. Endpoint returns JSON response with document `id`, `filename`, and `status`\n5. Server-side validation errors return 400 status with actionable error messages matching client-side validation messages\n6. File upload errors (storage failures) return 500 status with error logged and user-friendly message returned\n7. Unit tests verify validation logic, integration tests verify Supabase storage operations\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Create Pydantic models for request/response (AC: 3, 4)\n  - [ ] Create/update `backend/app/models/schemas.py`\n  -

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.2 - Supabase Integration]
- Supabase client configured with `supabase_service` singleton
- Documents table schema: id (UUID), filename, status, processing_options, created_at, completed_at, error_message
- Storage buckets created: `uploads` (original files), `processed` (markdown files)
- Service methods available: `create_document_record()`, `upload_file()`, `download_file()`
- RLS policies enabled for secure access

[Source: Story 1.3 - File Upload UI]
- Frontend expects `POST /api/upload` endpoint
- Client sends multipart/form-data with file + processing options
- Expected response: `{id: UUID, filename: string, status: 'queued'}`
- Frontend validation messages must match backend errors exactly:
  - "Unsupported file type - only PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX allowed"
  - "File too large - maximum 10MB"

### Current Backend Implementation Status
[Source: backend/app/api/endpoints/upload.py]

**Already Implemented:**
- `POST /upload` endpoint exists with basic structure
- File type validation using `settings.ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES`
- File size validation (10MB limit)
- Document record creation in database
- File upload to Supabase `uploads` bucket
- Background task processing trigger
- Error handling with HTTPException
- Logging for uploads

**Needs Enhancement:**
- Move validation logic to separate utilities module
- Add UUID-based unique filename generation
- Enhance error messages to match frontend exactly
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Add integration tests with actual Supabase
- Improve error handling granularity

### File Validation Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md, Epic 1.4 AC #1, #5]

**Allowed File Types:**
```python
ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES = {
    'application/pdf': ['.pdf'],
    'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document': ['.docx'],
    'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation': ['.pptx'],
    'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet': ['.xlsx'],
}

ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = ['.pdf', '.docx', '.pptx', '.xlsx']
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10485760  # 10MB in bytes
```

**Validation Rules:**
1. Check both file extension AND MIME type (double validation)
2. File size checked by reading actual content length
3. Reject empty files (size = 0)
4. Case-insensitive extension matching

**Error Messages (must match frontend):**
```python
FILE_TYPE_ERROR = "Unsupported file type - only PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX allowed"
FILE_SIZE_ERROR = "File too large - maximum 10MB"
EMPTY_FILE_ERROR = "File is empty"
```

### Unique Filename Generation
[Source: Epic 1.4 AC #2]

**Strategy: UUID Prefix + Original Filename**
```python
import uuid
from pathlib import Path

def generate_unique_filename(original_filename: str) -> str:
    """Generate unique filename with UUID prefix."""
    file_uuid = str(uuid.uuid4())
    extension = Path(original_filename).suffix
    safe_name = Path(original_filename).stem[:100]  # Limit name length
    return f"{file_uuid}_{safe_name}{extension}"
```

**File Path Structure in Storage:**
```
uploads/
  └── <document_id>/
      └── <uuid>_<original_filename>
      
Example: uploads/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/7d3e9f2a-1b4c-4e8d-9a3f-c5b8d7e6f1a2_report.pdf
```

**Benefits:**
- No filename collisions (UUID guarantees uniqueness)
- Preserves original filename for user reference
- Organizes files by document ID for easy cleanup
- Prevents path traversal attacks

### Pydantic Models for Upload
[Source: backend/app/models/schemas.py]

**Already Defined:**
```python
class ProcessingOptions(BaseModel):
    ocr_enabled: bool = False
    processing_mode: ProcessingMode = ProcessingMode.FAST  # 'fast' | 'quality'

class FileUploadResponse(BaseModel):
    id: str
    filename: str
    status: DocumentStatus  # Will be 'queued'
    message: str = "File uploaded successfully"

class DocumentStatus(str, Enum):
    QUEUED = "queued"
    PROCESSING = "processing"
    COMPLETE = "complete"
    FAILED = "failed"
```

**Usage in Endpoint:**
```python
@router.post("/upload", response_model=FileUploadResponse)
async def upload_document(
    file: UploadFile = File(...),
    ocr_enabled: bool = False,
    processing_mode: str = "fast"
) -> FileUploadResponse:
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Supabase Service Integration
[Source: backend/app/services/supabase_service.py]

**Available Methods:**
```python
# Document database operations
await supabase_service.create_document_record(
    filename=str,
    processing_options=dict
) -> str  # Returns document_id

await supabase_service.update_document_status(
    document_id=str,
    status=str,
    error_message=Optional[str]
) -> bool

await supabase_service.get_document(document_id=str) -> dict

# File storage operations
await supabase_service.upload_file(
    bucket=str,  # 'uploads' or 'processed'
    file_path=str,
    file_content=bytes,
    content_type=str
) -> bool

await supabase_service.download_file(
    bucket=str,
    file_path=str
) -> bytes
```

**Enhancement Needed:**
Add `generate_unique_filename()` method to service or create separate utility.

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Error-Handling]

**HTTP Status Codes:**
- **400 Bad Request**: Client validation errors (file type, size)
- **422 Unprocessable Entity**: Pydantic validation errors (missing file)
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server/storage failures

**Error Response Format:**
```python
# Client errors (400)
raise HTTPException(
    status_code=400,
    detail="Unsupported file type - only PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX allowed"
)

# Server errors (500)
raise HTTPException(
    status_code=500,
    detail="Storage service unavailable - please try again"
)
```

**Logging Requirements:**
```python
# Success logging
logger.info(f"Document uploaded: {doc_id}, file: {filename}, size: {file_size}")

# Validation error logging
logger.warning(f"Upload validation failed: {filename}, reason: {error_reason}")

# Storage error logging
logger.error(f"Storage upload failed: {filename}, error: {str(e)}")
```

**Error Context:**
- Log filename (safe to log, not sensitive)
- Log file size for size errors
- Log content type for type errors
- Log document ID for tracking
- Never log file content
- Sanitize error messages for client (no stack traces)

### Testing Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Testing-Standards]

**Unit Tests (backend/tests/test_validators.py):**
- Test validation functions in isolation
- Mock Supabase operations
- Fast execution (<1 second total)
- No external dependencies

**Integration Tests (backend/tests/test_services/test_file_upload.py):**
- Test with actual Supabase test instance
- Upload real files, verify storage
- Clean up test data after each test
- Requires Supabase credentials

**API Tests (backend/tests/test_api/test_upload.py):**
- Use FastAPI TestClient
- Mock Supabase service layer
- Test HTTP request/response flow
- Test error handling

**E2E Tests (backend/tests/test_api/test_upload_e2e.py):**
- Full workflow: upload → database → storage
- Use sample files from fixtures
- Verify data persistence
- Test concurrent uploads

**Test Fixtures Structure:**
```
backend/tests/fixtures/sample_files/
├── sample.pdf         # Valid PDF, ~500KB
├── sample.docx        # Valid Word doc, ~200KB
├── sample.pptx        # Valid PowerPoint, ~300KB
├── sample.xlsx        # Valid Excel, ~100KB
├── large.pdf          # 9.5MB PDF (size limit test)
├── invalid.txt        # Invalid file type
└── empty.pdf          # 0 byte file
```

### Configuration Management
[Source: backend/app/core/config.py]

**Current Settings:**
```python
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    MAX_FILE_SIZE: int = 10 * 1024 * 1024  # 10MB
    ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES: List[str] = [
        "application/pdf",
        "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document",
        "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation",
        "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet",
    ]
    PROCESSING_TIMEOUT: int = 300  # 5 minutes
```

**Usage in Upload Endpoint:**
```python
from app.core.config import settings

if file.content_type not in settings.ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=FILE_TYPE_ERROR)

if file_size > settings.MAX_FILE_SIZE:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=FILE_SIZE_ERROR)
```

### File Upload Flow
[Source: Epic 1.4 AC #1-4]

**Complete Upload Sequence:**
```
1. Receive multipart/form-data request
   - Extract file, ocr_enabled, processing_mode

2. Validate file
   - Check file exists and has filename
   - Validate MIME type in ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES
   - Validate extension in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS
   - Read file content
   - Validate size <= MAX_FILE_SIZE
   - Reject if empty (size = 0)

3. Generate unique file path
   - Create UUID for document ID
   - Generate unique filename: <uuid>_<original_name>
   - Construct path: <doc_id>/<unique_filename>

4. Create database record
   - Call supabase_service.create_document_record()
   - Store: filename, status='queued', processing_options
   - Get document_id from response

5. Upload file to storage
   - Call supabase_service.upload_file()
   - Bucket: 'uploads'
   - Path: <doc_id>/<unique_filename>
   - Content-Type: from request

6. Return success response
   - Document ID (UUID string)
   - Original filename
   - Status: 'queued'

7. Error handling
   - Validation error → 400 + error message
   - Database error → Rollback, 500 error
   - Storage error → Delete DB record, 500 error
```

### Transaction Safety
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Database-Standards]

**Rollback Strategy:**
```python
try:
    # Create document record
    doc_id = await supabase_service.create_document_record(...)
    
    try:
        # Upload file to storage
        await supabase_service.upload_file(...)
        return success_response
        
    except StorageError:
        # Rollback: Delete document record
        await supabase_service.delete_document(doc_id)
        raise HTTPException(500, detail="Storage upload failed")
        
except DatabaseError:
    raise HTTPException(500, detail="Database error")
```

**Considerations:**
- Create database record first (easier to clean up)
- If storage fails, delete database record (orphan prevention)
- If database fails, no storage upload attempted
- Log all failures for debugging
