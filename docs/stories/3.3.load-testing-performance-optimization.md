# Story 3.3: Load Testing & Performance Optimization

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** workshop facilitator,
**I want** the system validated for 30 concurrent users with acceptable performance,
**so that** all attendees can use the tool simultaneously without failures or slowdowns.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Load test executed simulating 30 concurrent users each uploading and processing documents (mix of file types, processing options)
2. System handles 30 concurrent uploads without crashes, 500 errors, or request timeouts (5-minute processing limit not exceeded)
3. DigitalOcean auto-scaling triggers appropriately: frontend and backend services scale up when load increases, scale down when load decreases
4. Performance metrics captured: response time p95 for upload endpoint, processing completion time p95, concurrent processing capacity (how many Docling processes run simultaneously)
5. Database query performance validated: status polling by 30 users doesn't degrade response times, connection pooling configured appropriately
6. Storage bandwidth sufficient: 30 simultaneous downloads don't exceed Supabase limits or cause throttling
7. Optimization implemented if performance issues found: increase worker processes, optimize database queries, adjust auto-scaling thresholds, implement request queuing if needed
8. Load test report documents: max concurrent capacity, performance at 30 users vs. baseline, identified bottlenecks and mitigations

- DigitalOcean Load Testing for cloud-native testing

**Test Scenarios:**
```python
# Locust load test example
class WorkshopUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 3)
    
    def on_start(self):
        """Initialize user session"""
        self.client.get("/")
    
    @task(3)
    def upload_document(self):
        """Upload document for processing"""
        files = {
            'file': ('test.pdf', open('test.pdf', 'rb'), 'application/pdf')
        }
        data = {
            'processing_mode': 'quality',
            'enable_ocr': 'true'
        }
        response = self.client.post("/api/upload", files=files, data=data)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            self.document_id = response.json()['document_id']
    
    @task(5)
    def check_status(self):
        """Check processing status"""
        if hasattr(self, 'document_id'):
            self.client.get(f"/api/status/{self.document_id}")
    
    @task(2)
    def download_document(self):
        """Download processed document"""
        if hasattr(self, 'document_id'):
            self.client.get(f"/api/download/{self.document_id}")
```

### DigitalOcean Auto-Scaling Configuration
[Source: docs/deployment/digitalocean-config-updates.md]

**Auto-Scaling Policies:**
```yaml
# Frontend scaling
frontend:
  min_instances: 1
  max_instances: 5
  cpu_threshold: 70%
  memory_threshold: 80%
  scale_up_cooldown: 300s
  scale_down_cooldown: 600s

# Backend scaling
backend:
  min_instances: 1
  max_instances: 10
  cpu_threshold: 60%
  memory_threshold: 75%
  scale_up_cooldown: 180s
  scale_down_cooldown: 300s
```

**Scaling Metrics to Monitor:**
- CPU utilization percentage
- Memory usage percentage
- Request queue length
- Response time p95
- Error rate percentage
- Concurrent active connections

### Database Performance Optimization
[Source: docs/architecture.md#Backend-Architecture]

**Connection Pooling:**
```python
# Database connection pool configuration
DATABASE_CONFIG = {
    "pool_size": 20,           # Base connections
    "max_overflow": 30,        # Additional connections under load
    "pool_timeout": 30,        # Wait time for connection
    "pool_recycle": 3600,      # Connection lifetime
    "pool_pre_ping": True      # Health check
}
```

**Query Optimization:**
```sql
-- Index for status polling queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_documents_status_updated 
ON documents(status, updated_at) 
WHERE status IN ('processing', 'completed');

-- Partition large tables by date if needed
CREATE TABLE documents_2025_10 PARTITION OF documents
FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-10-01') TO ('2025-11-01');
```
