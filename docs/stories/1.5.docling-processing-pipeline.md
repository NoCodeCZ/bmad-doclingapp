\n# Story 1.5: Docling Processing Pipeline\n\n## Status\nDraft\n\n## Story\n**As a** backend service,\n**I want** document processing workflow using Docling to convert files to markdown,\n**so that** uploaded documents are transformed into AI-optimized format.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. Docling library integrated with basic configuration (Fast mode, no OCR for initial implementation)\n2. `POST /api/process/{document_id}` endpoint triggers processing: updates status to 'processing', retrieves file from `uploads` bucket, invokes Docling conversion\n3. Docling output (markdown text) stored in Supabase `processed` bucket with matching filename pattern (`{original-name}.md`)\n4. On successful processing: status updated to 'complete', `completed_at` timestamp set, processed file path stored in metadata\n5. On processing failure: status updated to 'failed', `error_message` populated with Docling error details, original file remains in uploads bucket\n6. Processing timeout enforced at 5 minutes, triggering failure status if exceeded\n7. Unit tests mock Docling operations, integration tests verify full pipeline with sample PDF file\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Verify Docling library installation (AC: 1)\n  - [ ] Confirm `docling` package in requirements.txt\n  -

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.2 - Supabase Integration]
- Supabase client configured with `supabase_service` singleton
- Documents table schema includes: status, processing_options, completed_at, error_message fields
- Storage buckets: `uploads` (original files), `processed` (markdown files)
- Service methods: `upload_file()`, `download_file()`, `update_document_status()`

[Source: Story 1.4 - Backend File Upload]
- Upload endpoint creates documents with status='queued'
- Processing options stored in database: `{ocr_enabled: bool, processing_mode: str}`
- File path structure: `{document_id}/{filename}` in uploads bucket
- Document IDs are UUIDs returned from upload endpoint

### Current Implementation Status
[Source: backend/app/services/processing_service.py]

**Already Implemented:**
- `ProcessingService` class with `process_document()` method
- Docling `DocumentConverter` initialization
- Status update workflow: queued → processing → complete/failed
- File download from uploads bucket
- Temporary file handling with automatic cleanup
- Docling conversion with pipeline options configuration
- Fast mode and Quality mode support
- OCR configuration based on processing_options
- Markdown output upload to processed bucket
- Error handling with status updates and error messages
- Logging for processing events

**Processing Flow:**
```python
1. Update status to 'processing'
2. Download file from uploads bucket
3. Create temporary file
4. Configure Docling pipeline options (Fast/Quality, OCR)
5. Convert document to markdown
6. Upload markdown to processed bucket
7. Update status to 'complete'
8. Clean up temporary file
9. Handle errors: update status to 'failed' with error message
```

[Source: backend/app/api/endpoints/process.py]

**Already Implemented:**
- `POST /api/process/{document_id}` endpoint
- Document validation (exists, status='queued')
- Background task processing with `BackgroundTasks`
- Error handling (404 for not found, 400 for invalid status)
- Response format: `{message, document_id, status}`

**Needs Enhancement:**
- Add timeout enforcement mechanism
- Add more comprehensive unit tests
- Add integration tests with actual Docling
- Verify endpoint registration in main app
- Add performance monitoring

### Docling Configuration
[Source: backend/app/services/processing_service.py, docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Docling Library:**
```python
from docling.document_converter import DocumentConverter
from docling.datamodel.pipeline_options import PdfPipelineOptions
from docling.backend.pypdfium2_backend import PyPdfiumDocumentBackend
```

**Fast Mode Configuration:**
```python
pipeline_options = PdfPipelineOptions()
pipeline_options.do_ocr = False  # or based on user preference
pipeline_options.do_table_structure = False  # Faster processing
```

**Quality Mode Configuration:**
```python
pipeline_options = PdfPipelineOptions()
pipeline_options.do_ocr = True  # if OCR enabled
pipeline_options.do_table_structure = True  # Better accuracy
```

**Conversion Process:**
```python
converter = DocumentConverter(format_options={"pipeline_options": pipeline_options})
result = converter.convert(file_path)
markdown_content = result.document.export_to_markdown()
```

### File Path Patterns
[Source: Epic 1.5 AC #3, backend/app/services/processing_service.py]

**Input File Path (uploads bucket):**
```
{document_id}/{filename}
Example: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/report.pdf
```

**Output File Path (processed bucket):**
```
{document_id}/{basename}.md
Example: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/report.md
```

**Filename Transformation:**
- `report.pdf` → `report.md`
- `document.docx` → `document.md`
- `presentation.pptx` → `presentation.md`
- `spreadsheet.xlsx` → `spreadsheet.md`

### Processing Timeout Implementation
[Source: Epic 1.5 AC #6]

**Timeout Strategy:**
```python
import asyncio

async def process_with_timeout(document_id: str, filename: str, options: dict):
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(
            processing_service.process_document(document_id, filename, options),
            timeout=300  # 5 minutes
        )
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        await supabase_service.update_document_status(
            document_id,
            'failed',
            'Processing timeout exceeded (5 minutes)'
        )
        logger.error(f"Processing timeout for document {document_id}")
```

**Timeout Handling:**
- Set timeout to 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- Catch `asyncio.TimeoutError` exception
- Update status to 'failed' with timeout error message
- Log timeout event for monitoring
- Clean up temporary files if applicable

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Error-Handling]

**Error Categories:**
1. **File Download Errors** - File not found in uploads bucket
2. **Docling Conversion Errors** - Invalid/corrupted document
3. **Upload Errors** - Failed to upload markdown to processed bucket
4. **Timeout Errors** - Processing exceeds 5 minutes
5. **Validation Errors** - Document not found or wrong status

**Error Response Format:**
```python
# Processing errors update database
await supabase_service.update_document_status(
    document_id,
    'failed',
    f"Processing failed: {error_details}"
)

# API errors return HTTP exceptions
raise HTTPException(
    status_code=404,
    detail="Document not found"
)
```

**Logging Requirements:**
```python
# Success logging
logger.info(f"Document {document_id} processed successfully")

# Processing stage logging
logger.debug(f"Starting Docling conversion for {document_id}")

# Error logging
logger.error(f"Document processing failed for {document_id}: {str(e)}")
```

### Testing Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Testing-Standards]

**Unit Tests (test_services/test_processing_service.py):**
- Mock Docling `DocumentConverter`
- Mock Supabase service operations
- Test processing workflow with different configurations
- Test error handling scenarios
- Fast execution (<1 second per test)

**Integration Tests (test_services/test_docling_integration.py):**
- Use actual Docling library (not mocked)
- Test with real sample files
- Verify markdown output quality
- Test all supported file types (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX)
- Verify processing modes work correctly

**API Tests (test_api/test_process.py):**
- Use FastAPI TestClient
- Mock processing service
- Test HTTP request/response flow
- Test validation and error handling

**E2E Tests (test_api/test_process_e2e.py):**
- Full workflow: upload → process → verify storage
- Use actual Supabase instance
- Test with sample files from fixtures
- Verify data persistence
- Test error scenarios

**Test Fixtures:**
```
backend/tests/fixtures/sample_files/
├── sample.pdf         # Valid PDF, ~500KB
├── sample.docx        # Valid Word doc, ~200KB
├── sample.pptx        # Valid PowerPoint, ~300KB
├── sample.xlsx        # Valid Excel, ~100KB
├── medium.pdf         # 5MB PDF (performance test)
├── large.pdf          # 9.5MB PDF (timeout test)
└── corrupted.pdf      # Invalid PDF (error test)
```

### Processing Performance Targets
[Source: Epic context and tech stack]

**Performance Goals:**
- Small files (1MB): < 30 seconds
- Medium files (5MB): < 2 minutes
- Large files (10MB): < 5 minutes (within timeout)

**Mode Comparison:**
- Fast mode: ~2-3x faster than Quality mode
- OCR disabled: ~3-5x faster than OCR enabled
- PDF processing: Fastest (native format)
- DOCX/PPTX/XLSX: Slightly slower (conversion required)
