# Story 3.6: Documentation & Handoff Materials

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** workshop facilitator and future maintainer,
**I want** comprehensive documentation covering operation, troubleshooting, and future enhancements,
**so that** the tool can be supported beyond the initial workshop.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User documentation finalized: Instructions page (Story 3.1) reviewed for clarity, FAQ section added covering common questions (processing time expectations, file type support, Open WebUI integration)
2. Operational runbook created: how to access DigitalOcean dashboards, how to check logs for errors, how to manually restart services, how to scale resources if needed
3. Troubleshooting guide for facilitators: common error messages and resolutions, how to verify Supabase connectivity, how to check Docling processing logs, emergency contact procedures
4. Technical documentation updated: architecture diagram (frontend ↔ backend ↔ Supabase flow), API endpoint documentation, environment variable reference, deployment procedures
5. Post-workshop enhancement backlog documented: features mentioned in brief as "out of scope" (batch upload, processing history, user auth), performance optimizations identified during testing
6. Maintenance plan outlined: who owns the tool post-workshop, how to handle user requests, process for deploying updates, data retention/cleanup policy
7. Handoff meeting scheduled with workshop facilitators and future maintainers covering all documentation
