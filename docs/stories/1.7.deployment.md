\n# Story 1.7: DigitalOcean Deployment & CI/CD\n\n## Status\nDraft\n\n## Story\n**As a** developer,\n**I want** automated deployment to DigitalOcean App Platform with staging and production environments,\n**so that** the application is accessible for testing and ready for workshop use.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. DigitalOcean App Platform configured with two services: `frontend` (Next.js) and `backend` (FastAPI) both deploying from monorepo\n2. Staging environment deployed with separate Supabase instance/buckets for testing\n3. Environment variables configured for both services (Supabase credentials, API URLs, file size limits)\n4. Health check endpoints (`/api/health` for backend, `/_health` for frontend) configured in DigitalOcean for monitoring\n5. Deployment succeeds for both services with publicly accessible URLs (e.g., `https://frontend.ondigitalocean.app`, `https://backend.ondigitalocean.app`)\n6. Basic smoke test passes: upload sample PDF → process → download markdown in staging environment\n7. Deployment documentation includes rollback procedures and environment variable management\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Create DigitalOcean App Spec configuration (AC: 1, 3)\n  - [ ] Create `.digitalocean/app.yaml` with monorepo structure\n  - [ ] Configure frontend service: build command, run command, environment variables\n  - [ ] Configure backend service: build command, run command, environment variables\n  - [ ] Set up CORS configuration for cross-origin requests\n  -

name: backend\n    type: worker\n    build_command: cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt\n    run_command: cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080\n    \n  - name: frontend\n    type: web\n    build_command: cd frontend && npm install && npm run build\n    run_command: cd frontend && npm start\n```\n\n**Container Deployment:**\n- Frontend and backend run as separate containers\n- Auto-scaling enabled for both services\n- Built-in load balancing\n- Managed SSL certificates\n- CDN integration for frontend static assets\n\n### Environment Variables Configuration\n[Source: architecture.md#Environment-Variables]\n\n**Backend Environment Variables:**\n```bash\nSUPABASE_URL=https://[project-id].supabase.co\nSUPABASE_KEY=[service-role-key]\nDEBUG=false\nMAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760  # 10MB\nPROCESSING_TIMEOUT=300  # 5 minutes\nALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://[frontend-url].ondigitalocean.app\n```\n\n**Frontend Environment Variables:**\n```bash\nNEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://[backend-url].ondigitalocean.app\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://[project-id].supabase.co\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[anon-key]\n```\n\n### Health Check Endpoints\n[Source: architecture.md#API-Specification]\n\n**Backend Health Check:** `GET /api/health`\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"ok\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2025-10-04T14:30:00Z\"\n}\n```\n\n**Frontend Health Check:** `GET /_health` (needs to be created)\n- Simple endpoint that returns 200 OK\n- Used by DigitalOcean to determine service health\n- Should check basic Next.js server functionality\n\n### Deployment Flow\n[Source: architecture.md#CI/CD-Pipeline]\n\n1. **Code Push:** Push to `main` branch triggers deployment\n2. **Build Phase:** DigitalOcean builds both frontend and backend containers\n3. **Deploy Phase:** New containers replace old ones (zero-downtime)\n4. **Health Checks:** Services must pass health checks before traffic routing\n5. **Monitoring:** DigitalOcean monitoring tracks metrics and logs\n\n### Known Configuration Requirements\n\n**Monorepo Build Commands:**\n- Must use `cd backend` and `cd frontend` in build/run commands\n- Build commands run from repository root\n- Environment variables are service-specific\n\n**CORS Configuration:**\n- Backend must allow frontend origin in CORS settings\n- Already configured in `backend/app/main.py` via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`\n- Must update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` with actual frontend URL after deployment\n\n**Next.js Configuration:**\n- `next.config.js` should have `output: 'standalone'` for optimal Docker builds\n- Requires proper `package.json` scripts: `build`, `start`\n- Already configured in existing codebase\n\n### Supabase Staging Instance Setup\n[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Database-&-Storage-Stack]\n\n**Required Steps:**\n1. Create new Supabase project for staging\n2. Run migration: `backend/supabase/migrations/001_create_documents_table.sql`\n3. Create storage buckets via Supabase UI:\n   - `uploads` (private, 10MB limit, allowed MIME types: PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX)\n   - `processed` (private, 10MB limit, allowed MIME types: text/markdown)\n4. Configure RLS policies (already in migration script)\n5. Copy credentials to DigitalOcean environment variables\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n**Smoke Test Checklist:**\n1. Frontend loads without errors\n2. Backend health check returns 200 OK\n3. File upload succeeds\n4. Document processing completes\n5. Markdown download works\n6. Error messages display correctly\n7. CORS works (no browser console errors)\n\n**Monitoring Points:**\n- Application logs (7-day retention in DigitalOcean)\n- CPU and memory usage\n- Request rate and response times\n- Error rate (4xx, 5xx)\n\n### Rollback Procedure\n[Source: deployment best practices]\n\n**DigitalOcean Rollback:**\n1. Access DigitalOcean App Platform dashboard\n2. Navigate to deployment history\n3. Select previous successful deployment\n4. Click \"Redeploy\" to rollback\n5. Monitor health checks during rollback\n\n**Alternative: Git Revert:**\n1. Identify commit to revert: `git log`\n2. Revert commit: `git revert <commit-hash>`\n3. Push to trigger new deployment: `git push origin main`\n\n### File Locations\n\n**Configuration Files:**\n- `.digitalocean/app.yaml` - DigitalOcean App Platform spec (to be created)\n- `backend/app/core/config.py` - Backend configuration with environment variables\n- `frontend/next.config.js` - Next.js configuration\n\n**Documentation Files:**\n- `docs/deployment/deployment-guide.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide (to be created)\n- `docs/deployment/digitalocean-config-updates.md` - Configuration updates (to be created)\n- `docs/deployment/supabase-setup.md` - Supabase staging setup (to be created)\n\n### Critical Considerations\n\n**Security:**\n- Never commit Supabase credentials to repository\n- Use DigitalOcean environment variables for all secrets\n- Ensure RLS policies are properly configured on staging\n\n**Performance:**\n- Enable auto-scaling for workshop day (30 concurrent users)\n- Monitor response times during smoke tests\n- Verify CDN caching for frontend static assets\n\n**Reliability:**\n- Health checks prev
ent unhealthy containers from receiving traffic
- Zero-downtime deployments ensure continuous availability
- Monitor logs immediately after deployment for any issues
