# Story 1.6: Markdown Download & Basic Frontend Flow

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** workshop attendee,
**I want** to download processed markdown files after upload completes,
**so that** I can use the converted document in Open WebUI.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Frontend polls `GET /api/status/{document_id}` every 2 seconds after upload to check processing status.
2. `GET /api/status/{document_id}` returns current status, filename, and download URL (if complete) or error message (if failed).
3. UI transitions from "Uploading..." → "Processing..." → "Complete" based on status updates.
4. Download button appears when status = `complete`, triggering `GET /api/download/{document_id}` which streams markdown file from processed bucket.
5. Downloaded file preserves original filename with `.md` extension (e.g., `report.pdf` → `report.md`).
6. "Process Another Document" button resets UI to upload screen after successful download.
7. Error state displays error message from backend with "Try Again" button returning to upload screen.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Align backend status and download responses (AC: 2, 4, 5)
  - [ ] Confirm [get_document_status](backend/app/api/endpoints/status.py:10) returns `download_url`, `progress_stage`, and `error_message` fields populated from Supabase metadata per [DocumentStatusResponse](backend/app/models/schemas.py:85).
  - [ ] Ensure [download_document](backend/app/api/endpoints/download.py:10) streams markdown with `Content-Disposition` using `{base_name}.md`, matching storage guidelines in [architecture/tech-stack.md#database--storage-stack](docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#database--storage-stack).
  - [ ] Verify processed object paths follow `{document_id}/{basename}.md` pattern established in [processing_service.py](backend/app/services/processing_service.py) and logged staging details from Story 1.5.
- [ ] Implement frontend status polling hook (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Create [useStatusPolling.ts](frontend/src/hooks/useStatusPolling.ts) to fetch [DocumentStatusResponse](frontend/src/types/database.ts:41) every 2 seconds until terminal status, honoring abort/cancellation when user resets.
  - [ ] Expose progress state (`status`, `progress_stage`, `error_message`, `download_url`, elapsed time) for reuse by [ProcessingCard.tsx](frontend/src/components/ProcessingCard.tsx:1).
  - [ ] Add exponential backoff / retry notice for transient network errors while keeping polling interval baseline at 2 seconds per [front-end-spec.md#Flow-1](docs/front-end-spec.md#flow-1-primary-document-conversion-happy-path).
- [ ] Update upload page state machine (AC: 1, 3, 6)
  - [ ] Refactor [page.tsx](frontend/src/app/page.tsx:1) to delegate upload handling to [useFileUpload](frontend/src/hooks/useFileUpload.ts:16) and new polling hook, ensuring React state transitions align with status values (`queued`, `processing`, `complete`, `failed`).
  - [ ] Display stage-specific messaging via [ProcessingCard](frontend/src/components/ProcessingCard.tsx:1) and maintain accessibility semantics defined in [front-end-spec.md#Processing-Status-Screen](docs/front-end-spec.md#screen-2-processing-status-screen).
  - [ ] Wire "Process Another Document" button to reset hooks, clear timers, and return to [FileDropzone](frontend/src/components/FileDropzone.tsx:1) initial state.
- [ ] Implement download + error controls (AC: 4, 5, 7)
  - [ ] Add primary action button that invokes `/api/download/{document_id}` and triggers browser download, keeping filename consistent with original extension mapping.
  - [ ] Surface backend `error_message` in destructive [Alert](frontend/src/components/ui/alert.tsx:1) with "Try Again" CTA that clears status and re-opens upload view, mirroring failure UX in [front-end-spec.md#Flow-2](docs/front-end-spec.md#flow-2-error-recovery-path).
  - [ ] Ensure manual download fallback via signed URL open (`window.open`) gracefully handles blocked pop-ups and provides instructional copy.
- [ ] Regression testing and QA automation (AC: 1-7)
  - [ ] Add unit tests for polling hook (happy path, timeout, failure) in [frontend/src/tests/hooks/useStatusPolling.test.ts](frontend/src/tests/hooks/useStatusPolling.test.ts) following [coding-standards.md#Frontend-Testing](docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#frontend-testing).
  - [ ] Extend [FileDropzone.test.tsx](frontend/src/tests/components/FileDropzone.test.tsx:1) and ProcessingCard tests to cover status transitions and download CTA enablement.
  - [ ] Create API contract tests hitting `/api/status` and `/api/download` using FastAPI `TestClient` under [backend/tests/test_api](backend/tests/test_api) to ensure consistent responses, referencing [coding-standards.md#Backend-Testing](docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#backend-testing).
- [ ] Manual validation checklist (AC: 1-7)
  - [ ] Execute end-to-end flow: upload sample, observe queued→processing→complete state, download markdown, reset to upload.
  - [ ] Validate failed processing scenario returns error copy and "Try Again" resets UI.
  - [ ] Confirm mobile responsiveness and keyboard navigation remain compliant with [front-end-spec.md#Accessibility](docs/front-end-spec.md#accessibility-requirements).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.5 finalizes Docling processing and records processed file paths that must be exposed for downloads in this flow. [docs/stories/1.5.docling-processing-pipeline.md](docs/stories/1.5.docling-processing-pipeline.md)

### Data Models
- Backend status serialization relies on [DocumentStatus](backend/app/models/schemas.py:10) and [ProcessingOptions](backend/app/models/schemas.py:24) enums; the frontend mirrors these via [DocumentStatus](frontend/src/types/database.ts:6) and [ProcessingOptions](frontend/src/types/database.ts:10) to guarantee consistent type safety.
- Download URLs should map to stored `processed_file_path` recorded in [processing_service.py](backend/app/services/processing_service.py) ensuring `.md` suffix retention.

### API Specifications
- Polling uses [get_document_status](backend/app/api/endpoints/status.py:10), which must return `download_url`, `progress_stage`, and `elapsed_time` to satisfy AC #1-3.
- Downloads stream through [download_document](backend/app/api/endpoints/download.py:10) with `StreamingResponse`, preserving content headers as outlined in [architecture/tech-stack.md#communication-stack](docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#communication-stack).

### Component Specifications
- Status presentation follows [ProcessingCard.tsx](frontend/src/components/ProcessingCard.tsx:1) spec, showing stage text, progress, and actionable buttons defined in [front-end-spec.md#Processing-Status-Screen](docs/front-end-spec.md#screen-2-processing-status-screen).
- Upload interactions stay within [FileDropzone.tsx](frontend/src/components/FileDropzone.tsx:1) and [useFileUpload](frontend/src/hooks/useFileUpload.ts:16), while the new polling hook coordinates with the main App Router page [page.tsx](frontend/src/app/page.tsx:1).

### File Locations
- Hooks live under `frontend/src/hooks` and UI components under `frontend/src/components`, matching the structure described in [source-tree.md#Frontend-Directory-Structure](docs/architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-directory-structure).
- FastAPI endpoints and service utilities remain in `backend/app/api/endpoints` and `backend/app/services`, per [source-tree.md#Backend-Directory-Structure](docs/architecture/source-tree.md#backend-directory-structure).

### Testing Requirements
- Follow React Testing Library conventions for UI behavior tests per [coding-standards.md#Frontend-Testing](docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#frontend-testing).
- Backend API tests must utilize pytest + FastAPI `TestClient` patterns in [coding-standards.md#Backend-Testing](docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#backend-testing) with fixtures in `backend/tests/fixtures/sample_files`.

### Technical Constraints
- Maintain 2-second polling cadence and responsive UX per [front-end-spec.md#User-Flows](docs/front-end-spec.md#user-flows).
- Ensure download streaming honors Supabase private bucket policies and DigitalOcean bandwidth considerations outlined in [architecture/tech-stack.md#infrastructure--deployment-stack](docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#infrastructure--deployment-stack).

## Testing
- Unit: Polling hook state transitions (queued→processing→complete, failure fallback).
- Component: [ProcessingCard](frontend/src/components/ProcessingCard.tsx:1) button enablement and messaging changes under different statuses.
- Integration: FastAPI status + download endpoints returning expected payloads for complete/failed documents.
- End-to-end: Browser workflow verifying upload→processing→download, including failure retry.
