# Workshop Document Processor - Developer Handoff Guide

## Overview

This handoff guide provides everything needed to begin implementation of the Workshop Document Processor. The project is a web application that converts office documents (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX) into AI-optimized markdown format using Docling, specifically designed for an October 17, 2025 workshop.

## Quick Start

### 1. Project Context
- **Timeline**: 13 days (October 5-17, 2025)
- **Goal**: Enable 30 workshop attendees to convert documents for Open WebUI
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14 + FastAPI + Supabase + DigitalOcean
- **Budget**: $10-12/month infrastructure

### 2. Immediate Actions
1. Read the complete PRD: [`docs/prd.md`](docs/prd.md:1)
2. Review the implementation plan: [`docs/implementation-plan.md`](docs/implementation-plan.md:1)
3. Set up development environment (see Environment Setup below)
4. Begin with Story 1.1: Project Initialization & Repository Setup

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20 LTS or later
- Python 3.11+ 
- Git
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone repository (when created)
git clone <repository-url>
cd workshop-document-processor

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd ../backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local  # Frontend
cp ../backend/.env.example ../backend/.env  # Backend
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Frontend (.env.local)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=your_backend_url

# Backend (.env)
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Start frontend (in terminal 1)
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Start backend (in terminal 2)
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Development Workflow

### Daily Structure
Follow the 13-day timeline from the implementation plan:
- **Days 1-6**: Epic 1 - Foundation & Core Processing Pipeline
- **Days 7-10**: Epic 2 - User Experience & Status Management  
- **Days 11-13**: Epic 3 - Production Readiness & Workshop Preparation

### Story Implementation
For each user story:
1. Review acceptance criteria in PRD
2. Follow implementation tasks in implementation plan
3. Adhere to coding standards
4. Write tests for critical functionality
5. Verify completion against acceptance criteria

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/story-1.1-project-setup

# Make changes with conventional commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and TailwindCSS"

# Push and create PR (when ready)
git push origin feature/story-1.1-project-setup
```

### Code Quality
- Run linting: `npm run lint` (frontend), `ruff check .` (backend)
- Format code: `npm run format` (frontend), `black .` (backend)
- Run tests: `npm test` (frontend), `pytest` (backend)

## Implementation Priorities

### Day 1 (October 5) - Critical Path
**Story 1.1: Project Initialization & Repository Setup**
- This is the foundation for everything else
- Must be completed before any other work
- Focus on getting both services running locally

### Day 2 (October 6) - Critical Path  
**Story 1.2: Supabase Integration & Database Schema**
- Database and storage are required for all subsequent features
- Set up Supabase project early to avoid delays
- Test connectivity thoroughly

### Day 3-6 (October 7-10) - Core Features
Focus on getting the basic upload→process→download workflow working:
- File upload UI (Day 3)
- Backend upload endpoint (Day 4) 
- Docling processing (Day 5)
- Download flow (Day 6)

### Day 7 (October 11) - Deployment
**Story 1.7: DigitalOcean Deployment & CI/CD**
- Deploy to staging early to validate infrastructure
- Essential for testing with real documents
- Don't wait until the end to test deployment

## Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- **Monorepo**: Single repository with `/frontend` and `/backend` directories
- **Services**: Two separate containers (Next.js + FastAPI) on DigitalOcean
- **Communication**: HTTP polling (no WebSocket complexity needed)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with private storage buckets

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: React hooks + Context API
- **File Upload**: react-dropzone library

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI with async support
- **Document Processing**: Docling library
- **Validation**: Pydantic models
- **Database**: Supabase client library

### File Processing
- **Supported Formats**: PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX
- **Processing Options**: OCR toggle, Fast/Quality modes
- **Output**: AI-optimized markdown for RAG
- **Storage**: Private Supabase buckets

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Frontend: Vitest + React Testing Library
- Backend: pytest + pytest-asyncio
- Focus on business logic and API endpoints

### Integration Tests
- Test API endpoints with real requests
- Validate Supabase operations
- Test file upload/download workflows

### Manual Testing
- End-to-end workflow validation
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness
- Real document testing

### Load Testing
- Simulate 30 concurrent users
- Test with various file types
- Validate performance under load

## Deployment Strategy

### Environments
- **Staging**: For testing and validation
- **Production**: For workshop day
- **Separate Supabase instances** for isolation

### Deployment Process
1. Push to main branch
2. DigitalOcean automatically deploys
3. Health checks validate deployment
4. Smoke tests verify functionality

### Monitoring
- DigitalOcean built-in metrics
- Health check endpoints
- Log aggregation
- Error alerting

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items
1. **Docling Processing Failures**
   - Test with diverse documents early
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Have fallback plans for workshop day

2. **Timeline Constraints**
   - Focus on MVP functionality
   - Defer non-essential features
   - Daily progress reviews

3. **Workshop Day Load**
   - Load test before workshop
   - Monitor system performance
   - Have scaling plan ready

### Daily Risk Mitigation
- Test each day's work thoroughly
- Don't move forward until acceptance criteria met
- Report blockers immediately
- Keep buffer time in schedule
