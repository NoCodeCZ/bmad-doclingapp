# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Successfully enable 80%+ of workshop attendees (30 people) to convert and use their own documents in Open WebUI during the October 17, 2025 workshop
- Deliver a production-ready web application that converts office documents (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX) into AI-optimized markdown format using Docling
- Achieve 95%+ successful conversion rate across all supported file types with processing times under 2 minutes
- Enable drag-and-drop simplicity requiring zero technical knowledge or manual formatting from users
- Deploy to production by October 16, 2025 (13-day development sprint with 1-day buffer)
- Dramatically improve RAG performance in Open WebUI by providing clean, well-structured markdown that enhances AI comprehension and retrieval quality

## Background Context

Employees need to leverage their own documents with Open WebUI's RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities, but raw office files suffer from critical extraction problems that severely degrade AI performance. PDF files produce fragmented text with poor structure preservation, complex layouts confuse standard parsers, and scanned documents remain unreadable without OCR. This results in RAG systems retrieving irrelevant chunks and AI responses lacking accuracy, forcing users to waste time on manual reformatting or abandoning the effort entirely.

The Workshop Document Processor solves this by leveraging Docling—an open-source document parser specifically optimized for AI consumption—to transform complex office documents into clean, semantically-rich markdown that maximizes RAG retrieval accuracy. Built for an internal workshop with 30 attendees on October 17, 2025, this tool provides a simple web interface (drag-and-drop upload → automatic processing → download markdown) with zero manual work required, filling the critical gap between "raw documents" and "RAG-ready content" that no existing solution addresses.
