# Epic List

## Epic 1: Foundation & Core Processing Pipeline
Establish project infrastructure (Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, Supabase integration, DigitalOcean deployment) while delivering the core document conversion capabilityâ€”users can upload a file, process it with Docling, and receive markdown output.

## Epic 2: User Experience & Status Management
Enhance the basic pipeline with real-time status updates, processing options (OCR toggle, Fast/Quality modes), error handling with actionable messages, and responsive UI refinements to create the polished workshop-ready experience.

## Epic 3: Production Readiness & Workshop Preparation
Implement mobile responsiveness, create the instructions page for Open WebUI integration, conduct comprehensive testing with diverse document types, perform load testing for 30 concurrent users, and finalize deployment with monitoring for workshop day stability.
