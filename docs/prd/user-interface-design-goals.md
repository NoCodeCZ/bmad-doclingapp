# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The Workshop Document Processor delivers a frictionless, single-purpose experience optimized for speed and clarity. Users should understand the entire workflow within 3 seconds of landing on the page: upload document → wait for processing → download markdown. Visual feedback dominates the interface—large drop zones, clear progress indicators, and prominent download buttons eliminate confusion. The design prioritizes "invisible complexity": sophisticated Docling processing and Supabase storage operate behind a deceptively simple interface that workshop attendees can use without documentation or assistance.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Drag-and-Drop First:** Primary interaction is dragging files onto a large, visually prominent drop zone; click-to-browse serves as secondary option
- **Status-Driven UI:** Interface morphs based on processing state (idle → uploading → processing → complete/error), showing only relevant actions at each stage
- **One Action Per Screen:** Each view focuses on a single user decision (upload file, configure options, download result) avoiding cognitive overload
- **Instant Feedback:** Every user action produces immediate visual response (file validation, upload progress, processing status) to maintain engagement during 1-2 minute processing times
- **Mobile-First Responsiveness:** Touch-friendly targets (minimum 44px), vertical layouts, and simplified mobile flows ensure workshop attendees can use phones/tablets if needed

## Core Screens and Views

- **Upload Screen (Landing Page):** Large drag-and-drop zone, processing options (OCR toggle, Fast/Quality mode selector), file type/size guidance
- **Processing Status Screen:** Real-time progress indicator, estimated time remaining, current processing stage (queued/processing), cancel option
- **Download Screen:** Prominent download button, success confirmation, filename display, "Process Another Document" action
- **Error Screen:** Clear error message, suggested corrective action, "Try Again" button
- **Instructions Page:** Step-by-step guide for uploading markdown to Open WebUI RAG with screenshots

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

WCAG AA compliance ensures workshop attendees with disabilities can use the tool effectively. Focus on keyboard navigation (all actions accessible without mouse), screen reader compatibility (ARIA labels for drag-drop zones and status updates), sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for text), and error identification (not relying solely on color to indicate validation errors).

## Branding

Minimal, professional styling aligned with internal tools aesthetic. Clean sans-serif typography, neutral color palette (grays, blues) with accent colors for status states (green for success, amber for processing, red for errors). No corporate branding required for MVP—prioritize clarity and functionality over visual polish. Design should feel "enterprise-lite": trustworthy but not bureaucratic.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary platform is desktop web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - last 2 versions), with full responsive support for tablets and smartphones. Workshop attendees will primarily use laptops, but mobile responsiveness ensures accessibility for users who arrive with only phones/tablets. Progressive enhancement approach: core functionality works on all devices, with enhanced features (drag-and-drop preview, advanced progress visualization) on desktop.
