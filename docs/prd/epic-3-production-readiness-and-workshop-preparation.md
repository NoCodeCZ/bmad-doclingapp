# Epic 3: Production Readiness & Workshop Preparation

**Epic Goal:** Finalize production deployment with comprehensive testing across diverse document types, validate system performance under workshop load conditions (30 concurrent users), create supporting documentation for Open WebUI integration, and ensure monitoring/stability for workshop day success.

## Story 3.1: Instructions Page for Open WebUI Integration

As a **workshop attendee**,
I want **clear step-by-step instructions for using processed markdown in Open WebUI**,
so that **I can successfully complete the end-to-end workflow from document upload to RAG usage**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Instructions page accessible from main navigation (link visible on upload screen and success screen)
2. Step-by-step guide with numbered instructions: (1) Process document using this tool, (2) Download markdown file, (3) Open Open WebUI, (4) Navigate to RAG/Documents section, (5) Upload markdown file, (6) Verify document appears in knowledge base
3. Screenshots or annotated images showing Open WebUI interface for each step (RAG navigation, upload button, confirmation screen)
4. Troubleshooting section addresses common issues: "Markdown not appearing in RAG" → check file format, "AI responses still inaccurate" → verify document uploaded to correct workspace
5. Tips for optimal results: "Use Quality mode for complex documents", "Enable OCR for scanned PDFs", "Break very large documents into sections"
6. Responsive layout: instructions readable on mobile devices, images scale appropriately without horizontal scrolling
7. "Back to Upload" navigation link returns users to main application flow

## Story 3.2: Diverse Document Type Testing & Edge Case Handling

As a **QA engineer**,
I want **the system validated against diverse real-world documents and edge cases**,
so that **workshop attendees experience high success rates regardless of document complexity**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Test suite includes diverse document types: clean digital PDF, scanned PDF (low and high quality), DOCX with tables/images, PPTX with complex layouts, XLSX with multiple sheets and formulas
2. Edge cases tested: password-protected files (should fail with clear message), corrupted files, files at size limits (9.9MB, 10.1MB), files with special characters in filenames, non-English language documents
3. Docling output quality validated: tables preserved in markdown format, heading hierarchy maintained, image placeholders inserted correctly, multi-column layouts handled gracefully
4. Processing time benchmarks documented per file type: PDF (p50, p95), DOCX (p50, p95), PPTX (p50, p95), XLSX (p50, p95)
5. Known limitations documented: file types that consistently fail, document features that don't convert well (embedded videos, complex charts), acceptable quality degradation scenarios
6. Bug fixes implemented for critical failures discovered during testing
7. Test report includes: success rate by file type, processing time distribution, error rate breakdown, recommendations for workshop messaging (set expectations on limitations)

## Story 3.3: Load Testing & Performance Optimization

As a **workshop facilitator**,
I want **the system validated for 30 concurrent users with acceptable performance**,
so that **all attendees can use the tool simultaneously without failures or slowdowns**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Load test executed simulating 30 concurrent users each uploading and processing documents (mix of file types, processing options)
2. System handles 30 concurrent uploads without crashes, 500 errors, or request timeouts (5-minute processing limit not exceeded)
3. DigitalOcean auto-scaling triggers appropriately: frontend and backend services scale up when load increases, scale down when load decreases
4. Performance metrics captured: response time p95 for upload endpoint, processing completion time p95, concurrent processing capacity (how many Docling processes run simultaneously)
5. Database query performance validated: status polling by 30 users doesn't degrade response times, connection pooling configured appropriately
6. Storage bandwidth sufficient: 30 simultaneous downloads don't exceed Supabase limits or cause throttling
7. Optimization implemented if performance issues found: increase worker processes, optimize database queries, adjust auto-scaling thresholds, implement request queuing if needed
8. Load test report documents: max concurrent capacity, performance at 30 users vs. baseline, identified bottlenecks and mitigations

## Story 3.4: Production Deployment & Monitoring Setup

As a **DevOps engineer**,
I want **production environment deployed with monitoring and alerting configured**,
so that **we can detect and respond to issues during the workshop**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Production environment deployed to DigitalOcean with separate Supabase production instance (isolated from staging)
2. Environment variables configured for production: Supabase production credentials, CORS settings (if frontend/backend on different subdomains), file size limits, processing timeouts
3. DigitalOcean monitoring dashboards configured tracking: CPU/memory usage per service, request rate, error rate (4xx, 5xx), response time p95
4. Log aggregation enabled: application logs from frontend and backend centralized in DigitalOcean logs with retention policy (7 days minimum)
5. Health check alerts configured: notify if health endpoints fail 3 consecutive times, alert if error rate exceeds 10% over 5-minute window
6. Backup strategy documented: database backup schedule (daily), storage bucket backup (manual pre-workshop snapshot), rollback procedure
7. Production smoke test passes: upload → process → download workflow for each file type succeeds in production environment

## Story 3.5: Workshop Rehearsal & Final Validation

As a **workshop facilitator**,
I want **a full rehearsal of workshop scenarios with real users**,
so that **we identify any remaining issues before October 17**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Rehearsal session conducted with 5-10 internal testers simulating workshop conditions: each tester uploads their own real documents, uses mobile and desktop devices
2. Testers follow complete workflow: access production URL → upload document → configure options → wait for processing → download markdown → upload to Open WebUI
3. Observed pain points documented: confusing UI elements, unclear error messages, unexpected failures, accessibility issues (keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility)
4. Success metrics measured: task completion rate (% who successfully download markdown), time to completion, error rate, user satisfaction score (1-5 scale)
5. Critical issues fixed immediately: blocking errors, major UX confusion, accessibility failures preventing task completion
6. Nice-to-have improvements deferred: minor polish, edge case handling, features beyond MVP scope
7. Workshop day runbook created: troubleshooting guide for facilitators, escalation path for technical issues, contact information for on-call developer, known limitations to communicate to attendees

## Story 3.6: Documentation & Handoff Materials

As a **workshop facilitator and future maintainer**,
I want **comprehensive documentation covering operation, troubleshooting, and future enhancements**,
so that **the tool can be supported beyond the initial workshop**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. User documentation finalized: Instructions page (Story 3.1) reviewed for clarity, FAQ section added covering common questions (processing time expectations, file type support, Open WebUI integration)
2. Operational runbook created: how to access DigitalOcean dashboards, how to check logs for errors, how to manually restart services, how to scale resources if needed
3. Troubleshooting guide for facilitators: common error messages and resolutions, how to verify Supabase connectivity, how to check Docling processing logs, emergency contact procedures
4. Technical documentation updated: architecture diagram (frontend ↔ backend ↔ Supabase flow), API endpoint documentation, environment variable reference, deployment procedures
5. Post-workshop enhancement backlog documented: features mentioned in brief as "out of scope" (batch upload, processing history, user auth), performance optimizations identified during testing
6. Maintenance plan outlined: who owns the tool post-workshop, how to handle user requests, process for deploying updates, data retention/cleanup policy
7. Handoff meeting scheduled with workshop facilitators and future maintainers covering all documentation
