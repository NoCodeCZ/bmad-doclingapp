# Risk Profile: Story 3.1

Date: 2025-10-06
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 88/100 (calculated)

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. DATA-001: Content accuracy in instructional screenshots

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Screenshots may become outdated as Open WebUI evolves
**Impact**: Medium - Users may experience confusion but can still follow text instructions

**Mitigation**:
- Create clear, text-based instructions that don't rely solely on screenshots
- Use generic screenshots or diagrams that illustrate concepts rather than exact UI
- Add disclaimer that interface may vary slightly
- Review instructions quarterly or when major changes are reported

**Testing Focus**: Content clarity tests, user comprehension testing

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Technical: 3 risks (0 critical)
- Performance: 2 risks (0 critical)
- Data: 1 risks (0 critical)
- Business: 1 risks (0 critical)
- Security: 1 risks (0 critical)

### By Component

- Frontend: 6 risks
- Content: 2 risks

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Category | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|-------|-------------------|
| DATA-001 | Data | Content accuracy in screenshots | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 6 | Preventive |
| TECH-001 | Technical | Navigation integration complexity | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Preventive |
| PERF-001 | Performance | Image loading performance | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Preventive |
| BUS-001 | Business | User confusion from unclear instructions | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Preventive |
| TECH-002 | Technical | Image asset management | Medium (2) | Low (1) | 2 | Preventive |
| SEC-001 | Security | XSS from user content | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Preventive |
| PERF-002 | Performance | Bundle size impact | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Preventive |
| TECH-003 | Technical | Component reusability | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Preventive |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- Content clarity and comprehension testing
- Screenshot relevance testing with users
- Navigation integration tests across all entry points
- Performance tests for image loading

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests for all components
- Asset loading and fallback mechanism tests
- Responsive design tests on different screen sizes
- Accessibility compliance tests

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- Security scanning for XSS vulnerabilities
- Bundle size analysis and optimization
- Component reusability tests

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- High risks affecting user experience (DATA-001) - Clear text instructions and disclaimer required

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with standard development practices (TECH-001, PERF-001)
- Low risks with standard testing procedures

### Accepted Risks

- All low risks with standard development practices
- Documented and monitored during development

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- User feedback on instruction clarity
- Performance metrics for image loading
- Navigation usage patterns
- Error rates for asset loading

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- User feedback indicates instruction confusion
- Performance issues are reported
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered
- Major UI changes are planned

## Mitigation Action Plan

### Immediate Actions (Before Development)

1. **Content Strategy** - Focus on clear text instructions with supporting visuals
2. **Screenshot Guidelines** - Use conceptual diagrams rather than exact UI replication
3. **Navigation Planning** - Review existing navigation components

### Development Phase Actions

1. **User Testing** - Test instruction clarity with target users
2. **Performance Optimization** - Implement lazy loading and optimization
3. **Accessibility Implementation** - Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Post-Deployment Actions

1. **User Feedback Collection** - Monitor user experience and comprehension
2. **Content Review Schedule** - Quarterly review of instruction accuracy
3. **Performance Monitoring** - Track image loading and navigation metrics

## Overall Risk Assessment

This story involves creating an instructions page with moderate technical complexity. The primary risk is content accuracy in screenshots (DATA-001), but this is mitigated by focusing on clear text instructions rather than exact UI replication. Since there's no actual integration with Open WebUI, the risk profile is significantly lower than initially assessed.

The implementation complexity is low to medium, with most technical risks being standard frontend development challenges. The business impact is medium as it supports user success but doesn't involve critical functionality.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with development focusing on clear, text-based instructions with supporting visuals. Standard development practices and testing will adequately address the identified risks.

## Gate Impact

With the corrected understanding that this is an instructions page without actual Open WebUI integration:
- No critical risks identified
- Only 1 high risk (content accuracy) with clear mitigation strategies
- Overall risk score improved from 73/100 to 88/100
- Gate status can be updated from CONCERNS to PASS with proper mitigation implementation
